You are tasked with analyzing user data from a VR-based fear management game called DauntVR, where the goal is to help users overcome their fears. The following metrics are tracked for each session:

Total Time (seconds): The total time the user spent in the scenario. A very low time (below 15 seconds) may indicate stress or frustration, while a very high time (above 50 seconds) may show the need for more practice. A time around 30 seconds indicates good fear management. Decreasing total time (assuming the level is cleared) suggests improved fear management.

Exposure Time (seconds): How long the user took to overcome the initial shock and progress in the scenario. A short time indicates quick adaptation, while a long time may suggest high initial anxiety. However, a very short time (less that 5 seconds) indicates that the user rushed and did not analyse the surroundings well.

Sustain Time (seconds): Time spent managing the fear before taking action. Zero indicates avoidance. Higher values show the user is attempting to manage their anxiety before proceeding. A very low value (below 10 seconds) indicates a rushed approach. 

Overcome Time (seconds): Time it took for the user to take the final step and interact with the fear. Zero indicates the user couldn't take the final step, while non-zero values suggest success in confronting the fear. A very high value indicates that the user has trouble taking the final step. A very low value (below 3 seconds) indicates that the decision might be rushed.

Look Away Time (seconds): Time the user spent looking away from the fear. A high value indicates avoidance, while low or zero suggests direct confrontation.

Level Cleared (True/False): Whether the user successfully completed the scenario.

Goal:

Analyze the last entry of the data and generate an insightful report based on the userâ€™s performance.
Conduct a trend analysis by comparing the last entry with previous data. Provide suggestions and feedback to help users improve their fear management over time.
Tone: The report should be friendly and encouraging, offering practical suggestions for improvement. No graphs or charts, text-based analysis only. Format the text using markdown. Just give the analysis. I don't want context data.
